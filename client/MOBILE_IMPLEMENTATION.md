# Mobile Implementation for Communications Dashboard

## Overview
The Communications Dashboard has been enhanced with mobile-friendly features that activate only on small screens (< 600px), while maintaining the professional desktop view.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Mobile-Friendly Filter Panel (`MobileFilterPanel.vue`)
- **Slide-in drawer** from the right side
- **Touch-optimized controls** with minimum 44px touch targets
- **Organized sections**:
  - Search
  - Quick Filters (Overdue, Unassigned, High Priority)
  - Advanced Filters (Region, Status, Priority, Coordinator)
  - Sort Options
  - Display Mode Toggle
- **Clear All** and **Apply Filters** buttons at the bottom

### 2. Mobile Project Cards (`MobileProjectCard.vue`)
- **Single-column layout** optimized for mobile screens
- **Progressive disclosure**:
  - Essential info visible by default
  - Tap to expand for full details
  - Smooth expand/collapse animation
- **Visual priority indicators**:
  - Border colors for urgent/high priority
  - Corner badges with alert icons
- **Touch-friendly actions**:
  - Three-dot menu for View/Edit/Delete
  - Large tap areas (minimum 44px)

### 3. Sticky Mobile Header
- **Compact design** with app title
- **Filter button** with active filter count badge
- **Quick access** to create new project (+) button
- **Stays visible** while scrolling

### 4. Mobile-Optimized Features
- **Full-width cards** with no margins on mobile
- **Compact pagination** with fewer visible pages
- **Active filter chips** below header for quick removal
- **Optimized spacing** throughout the interface

## Technical Implementation

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: > 600px (default professional view)
- **Mobile**: ≤ 600px (mobile-optimized view)

### Key Components Modified
1. `CommsDashboard.vue` - Main orchestrator with mobile detection
2. `ProjectList.vue` - Conditional rendering based on screen size
3. `comms-dashboard.css` - Mobile-specific styles

### Performance Considerations
- Components lazy-load based on viewport
- Touch events optimized for mobile
- Reduced DOM complexity on mobile

## Usage

### Desktop View (> 600px)
- Full feature set with multi-column layout
- All filters visible in toolbar
- Grid/List view toggle
- Export functionality

### Mobile View (≤ 600px)
- Single-column card layout
- Filters in slide-out panel
- Expandable cards for details
- Touch-optimized interactions

## Testing
The implementation automatically switches between desktop and mobile views based on viewport width. Test by:
1. Resizing browser window below 600px
2. Using browser developer tools device emulation
3. Accessing on actual mobile devices

## Future Enhancements
- Swipe gestures for card actions
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Offline support with service workers
- Enhanced loading states for slow connections
